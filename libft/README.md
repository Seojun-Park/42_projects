# 42_libft
First project of 42school.

What is libft?
-  Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some            additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

Disclaimer: 42 makes us do this as a first project as a cadet, so we can have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At 42, we're not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, so we have to keep growing this library with our own functions as we go further in the program.

What's in it?

As you can see from the Project instructions, there are 4 sections:

Libc Functions: Some of the standard C functions
Additional functions: Functions 42 deems will be useful for later projects
Bonus Functions: Functions 42 deems will be useful for linked list manipulation
Personal Functions: Functions I personally believe will be useful for further projects

Notes:

Most of the the files and function names are namespaced with an ft in front. It means Fourty Two which is name of school.
